# 🚗 AI Vehicle Counting System

## 📖 Overview

The AI Vehicle Counting System is an advanced computer vision application that automatically detects and counts vehicles crossing a user-defined line in video footage. Built using YOLOv8 for precise object detection and tracking, this intelligent system not only provides real-time vehicle counting but also leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4O vision model to analyze captured vehicle images, identifying specific vehicle colors and models with remarkable accuracy. This dual-AI approach combines state-of-the-art object detection with advanced visual intelligence to deliver comprehensive traffic analytics.

## ✨ Features

- **Bidirectional Counting**: Counts vehicles moving in both directions (up/down)
- **Interactive Line Drawing**: Click-based interface for setting counting lines
- **Vehicle Analytics**: AI-powered color and model identification
- **Visual Results**: Comprehensive charts and processed video output
- **Multi-format Support**: Supports MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WEBM video formats

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Video Processing Module
```python
def validate_video_file(file_path)
def get_video_details(video_file)
```
- Validates input video formats
- Extracts video metadata (resolution, fps, duration)
- Retrieves first frame for line drawing

#### 2. Line Drawing Interface
```python
def process_click_coordinates(...)
def draw_line_on_frame(...)
```
- Interactive click-based line definition
- Real-time visual feedback
- Coordinate validation and storage

#### 3. Vehicle Detection & Tracking
```python
def count_vehicles(video_file, x1, y1, x2, y2, progress)
```
- YOLOv8-based object detection
- Multi-object tracking with unique IDs
- Cross-product algorithm for direction detection

#### 4. Analytics Engine
```python
def analyze_folder_images(image_folder_path)
def create_results_chart(count_up, count_down)
```
- AI-powered vehicle identification using GPT-4O
- Statistical visualization
- Color and model distribution analysis

## 📊 Technical Details

### Vehicle Detection Classes

The system detects the following vehicle types (COCO dataset classes):
- **Class 2**: Car
- **Class 3**: Motorcycle
- **Class 5**: Bus
- **Class 7**: Truck

### Direction Detection Algorithm

Uses cross-product calculation to determine vehicle direction:

```python
def cross_product(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return x1 * y2 - y1 * x2
```

- **Positive cross-product**: Vehicle moving "down"
- **Negative cross-product**: Vehicle moving "up"

### Counting Logic

1. **State Tracking**: Each vehicle maintains a state (up/down)
2. **Transition Detection**: Counts when vehicle crosses line (state change)
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Each vehicle ID counted only once per direction

### AI-Powered Analytics

Integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4O API for:
- Vehicle color identification
- Specific model recognition
- Confidence-based classification
